> [!WARNING]
> Scriptly has now been folded into [**Vercengen**](https://github.com/Confoederatio/Vercengen/) as the component `ve.ScriptManager` as part of a runtime software engine, and this repository has now been deprecated.

**Scriptly** (stylised *SCRIPTLY_*) is an embeddable IDE platform for rapid script development using ES5/ES6 Javascript utiilising Blockly/CodeMirror (BlocksIDE). It was originally developed for the ScriptManager Component in [UF/Vercengen](https://github.com/Confoederatio/UniversalFramework), Confoederatio's main frontend software framework and engine. You may use Scriptly however you wish in your project, so long as attribution is provided to the original contributing base repository owner (see **Attribution**).

Because **Scriptly** is an Electron app, no web demo is provided for it online, although the original repository provided one via [GitHub Pages (Demo)](https://jc-orozco.github.io/BlocksIDE/build/index.html). Iframe bindings are also made available for Scriptly. They should be called through ContentDocument.

Multi-file management for end app components are implemented through Vercengen for the time being, although we plan on bundling it with the standalone version of the app in the future.

**Major Dependencies:**
- Blockly
- Electron
- Create React App (quarantined)
- BaklavaJS (planned)

## Attribution.

Credit goes to Juan Carlos Oroczo of [BlocksIDE](https://github.com/JC-Orozco/BlocksIDE) for much of the original transpiler code. Since Create React App has been deprecated in the years since the original repository was updated, we have quarantined it as a subsection of the main Electron process and refactored most of the Components to use composition over inheritance.
